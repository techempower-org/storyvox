     * # Why not DELETE-then-INSERT?
     *
     * Issue #879 — both `playback_position.chapterId` and
     * `chapter_history.chapterId` declare `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
     * A blanket `DELETE FROM chapter WHERE fictionId = ?` nukes the
     * user's resume position and reading-history rows for the fiction,
     * even though the same chapter rows are immediately re-inserted
     * with the same PKs. The FK CASCADE fires at DELETE statement
     * time (not deferred to COMMIT), so the damage is done before
     * the INSERT re-creates the parent rows.
     *
     * # Approach: park → upsert → prune
     *
     * 1. **Park** existing indexes into a reserved range above
     *    [PARK_OFFSET] so the `(fictionId, index)` UNIQUE constraint
     *    can't trip on mid-batch index swaps (RSS reorder, #349).
     * 2. **Upsert** the incoming batch via Room's `@Upsert` — this does
     *    `INSERT … ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET …`, which does NOT
     *    delete the row and therefore does NOT fire CASCADE.
     * 3. **Prune** chapters whose IDs are no longer in the incoming
     *    batch (genuinely removed by the source). CASCADE correctly
     *    fires here, deleting orphaned position/history rows for
     *    chapters that no longer exist.
     *
     * # History
     *
     * The first cut of this method (PR #349, RSS reorder crash) used a
     * two-phase park-then-upsert: bump existing rows above PARK_OFFSET
     * so the incoming positive indexes could land without tripping the
     * `(fictionId, index)` UNIQUE constraint mid-batch, then upsertAll
     * the fresh list. The intent was to preserve dropped rows' bodies
     * and download state at parked indexes — "feed slides, body lives".
     *
     * # Why DELETE-then-INSERT now (issue #652)
     *
     * On tablet R83W80CAFZB upgrading from v0.5.64 → v0.5.65+ the
     * parking path crashed with `SQLiteConstraintException: UNIQUE
     * constraint failed: chapter.fictionId, chapter.index` on opening
     * the TechEmpower Guides FictionDetail. Sequence of events:
     *
     *  1. v0.5.64 wrote 8 Guides chapters at indexes 0–7. The chapter
     *     at index 4 was "EBT spending" with PK
     *     `notion:<fid>::16f7018ad935...`.
     *  2. PR #648 (v0.5.65) removed "EBT spending" because its
     *     upstream Notion page started returning a 400. The new chapter
     *     list has 7 rows.
     *  3. First open after upgrade: parkChapterIndexesFor bumps all 8
     *     existing rows from 0–7 to 100000–100007. upsertAll writes 7
     *     new rows at 0–6, matching the 7 surviving PKs back to the
     *     live range. "EBT spending" stays parked at 100004.
     *  4. **Second open**: parkChapterIndexesFor only acts on rows in
     *     `[0, 100000)` so it tries to bump the 7 live rows 0–6 to
     *     100000–100006. The bump from index=4 to index=100004
     *     collides with the still-parked "EBT spending" at 100004.
     *     UNIQUE index fires; the FictionDetail screen crashes.
     *
     * Any time a chapter is permanently removed from a source's feed
     * (Notion page deleted, RSS entry expired, AO3 chapter pulled,
     * etc.) the parked row sticks around forever and the next refresh
     * has a roulette-wheel chance of colliding when the live indexes
     * cross the parked indexes' offsets.
     *
     * # Tradeoff
     *
     * The original parking design tried to preserve dropped chapters'
     * downloaded bodies for "later playback" — the idea being that if
     * a chapter falls off the feed window in a paginated source, the
     * user can still play what was already downloaded. In practice:
     *
     *  - The repository layer ([FictionRepositoryImpl.upsertDetail])
     *    already preserves bodies, download state, read state, etc.
     *    BY PK before this DAO call: it reads each incoming chapter's
     *    previous row and copies the body forward. So for any chapter
     *    that's in BOTH the old and new feed (the common case) body
     *    preservation happens above this layer regardless.
     *  - The only case the parking design protected was: chapter X
     *    was in feed yesterday, downloaded, then dropped from the
     *    feed today. With DELETE-then-INSERT, X's body is now lost.
     *
     * Per the v0.5.66 product decision: chapter lists are fully
     * replaced on every refresh; dropped rows do not survive. If a
     * future source needs window-style preservation, add a per-source
     * flag and branch in the repository layer rather than burdening
     * every refresh with the parking gymnastics.
     *
     * # FK-dependent tables (updated #879)
     *
     *  - `playback_position.chapterId → chapter.id ON DELETE CASCADE`
     *  - `chapter_history.chapterId → chapter.id ON DELETE CASCADE`
     *
     * Both declare FK CASCADE. Deleting a chapter row immediately
     * cascade-deletes the user's resume position and reading history
     * for that chapter. The park→upsert→prune approach only deletes
     * chapters that genuinely disappeared from the source.
